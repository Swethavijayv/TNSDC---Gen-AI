A Deep Dive into Shape Recognition - Utilizing CNNs for Circle and Square Identification

Shape up your understanding of CNNs with this hands-on project!

This project demonstrates how to create a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of shapes (circles and squares) without relying on external datasets. It's designed for educational and introductory purposes, aiming to solidify your grasp of core CNN concepts.

Key Features

Synthetic Data Generation: Generate your own training data for flexible learning.
Concise CNN Architecture: Explore the fundamental building blocks of CNNs.
Visualization Opportunities: Witness how a machine "sees" shapes through visualization (using Matplotlib).
Experimentation Playground: Adjust hyperparameters, explore model architectures, and delve into different image classification tasks.

Getting Started
